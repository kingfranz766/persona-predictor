## **How It Works**
_Users answer behavioral and preference-based questions via interactive sliders._

_The answers are compiled into a Dataframe._

_The input is passed to a machine learning model (logistic regression) that:_
  - Scales the input
  - Predicts personality type
  - Computes a confidence score

_The app then displays:_
  - Your predicted personality type
  - A radar chart showing your trait profile
  - A bar chart showing the top traits influencing the result
