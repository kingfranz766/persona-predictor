## **📦 Dependencies**
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

## **▶️ How to Run the App**

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   
3. Run the Streamlit app:
**streamlit run** persona_predictor.py

4. The app will open in your web browser at:
**http://localhost:8501**


## **How It Works**
1. Users answer behavioral and preference-based questions via interactive sliders.

2. The answers are compiled into a feature vector.

3. The input is passed to a machine learning model (logistic regression) that:
◦ Scales the input
◦ Predicts personality type
◦ Computes a confidence score

4. The app displays:
◦ Your predicted personality type
◦ A radar chart showing your trait profile
◦ A bar chart showing the top traits influencing the result
